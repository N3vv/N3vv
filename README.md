### Hi there 👋

I am a security researcher with a background initially focused on binary program analysis and cellular baseband firmware security. 

Currently, my work primarily centers on vulnerability discovery in areas such as NPU chip drivers and operating system components, along with exploring the application of LLM to enhance vulnerability discovery.
